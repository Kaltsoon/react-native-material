# React Native basics

Now that we have set up our development environment we can get into to React Native basics and get started with the development of our application. In this section, we will learn how to build user interfaces with React Native's core components, how to add style properties to these core components, how to transition between views, and how to manage form's state efficiently.

## Core components

In the previous parts, we have learned that we can use React to define components as functions which receive props as an argument and returns a tree of React elements. This tree is usually represented with JSX syntax. In the browser environment, we have used the [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) library to turn these components into a DOM tree that can be rendered by a browser. Here is a concrete example of a very simple component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  return <div>Hello world!</div>;
};
```

The `HelloWorld` component returns a single _div_ element which is created using the JSX syntax. We might remember that this JSX syntax is compiled into `React.createElement` method calls, such as this:

```javascript
React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello world!');
```

This line of code creates a _div_ element without any props and with a single child element which is a string _"Hello world"_. When we render this component into a root DOM element using the `ReactDOM.render` method the _div_ element will be rendered as the corresponding DOM element.

As we can see, React is not bound to a certain environment, such as the browser environment. Instead, there are libraries such as ReactDOM that can render _a set of predefined components_, such as DOM elements, in a specific environment. In React Native these predefined components are called _core components_.

[Core components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components) are a set of components provided by React Native which behind the scenes utilize the platform's native components. Let's implement the previous example using React Native:

<!-- TODO: highlight changed parts -->

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  return <Text>Hello world!</Text>;
};
```

So we import the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component from React Native and replace the _div_ element with a _Text_ element. Many familiar DOM elements have their React Native "counterparts". Here are some examples picked from the React Native's [Core Components documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis):

- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component is _the only_ React Native component that can have textual children. It is similar to for example the `<strong>` and the `<h1>` elements.
- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component is the basic user interface building block similar to the `<div>` element.
- [TextInput](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput) component is a text field component similar to the `<input>` element.
- [TouchableWithoutFeedback](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablewithoutfeedback) component (and other _Touchable\*_ components) component is for capturing different press events. It is similar to for example the `<button>` element.

There are a few notable differences between core components and DOM elements. The first difference is that the `Text` component is _the only_ React Native component that can have textual children. This means that you can't, for example, replace the `Text` component with the `View` component in the previous example.

The second notable difference is related to the event handlers. While working with the DOM elements we are used to adding event handlers such as `onClick` to basically any element such as `<div>` and `<button>`. In React Native we have to carefully read the [API documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) to know what event handlers (as well as other props) a component accepts. For example, the family of ["Touchable" components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches#touchables) provides the capability to capture tapping gestures and can display feedback when a gesture is recognized. One of these components is the [TouchableWithoutFeedback](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablewithoutfeedback) component, which accepts the `onPress` prop:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, TouchableWithoutFeedback, Alert } from 'react-native';

const TouchableText = (props) => {
  return (
    <TouchableWithoutFeedback
      onPress={() => Alert.alert('You pressed the text!')}
    >
      <Text>You can press me</Text>
    </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
  );
};
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of the core components, let's start to give our project some structure. Create a _src_ directory in the root directory of your project and in the _src_ directory create a _components_ directory. In the _components_ directory create a file _Main.jsx_ with the following content:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
import { Text, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    marginTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,
    flexGrow: 1,
    flexShrink: 1,
  },
});

const Main = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Rate Repository Application</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Main;
```

Next, let's use the `Main` component in the `App` component in the _App.js_ file which is located in our project's root directory. Replace the current content of the file with this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import Main from './src/components/Main';

const App = () => {
  return <Main />;
};

export default App;
```

## Manually reloading the application

As we have seen, Expo will automatically reload the application when we make changes to the code. However, there might be times when automatic reload isn't working and the application has to be reloaded manually. This can be achieved through the in-app developer menu.

You can access the developer menu by shaking your device or by selecting "Shake Gesture" inside the Hardware menu in the iOS Simulator. You can also use the `⌘D` keyboard shortcut when your app is running in the iOS Simulator, or `⌘M` when running in an Android emulator on Mac OS and `Ctrl+M` on Windows and Linux.

Once the developer menu is open, simply press "Reload" to reload the application. After the application has been reloaded, automatic reloads should work without the need for a manual reload.

## Exercise 10.3.

In this exercise, we will implement the first version of the reviewed repositories list. The list should contain the repository's full name, description, language, number of forks, number of stars, rating average and number of reviews. Luckily React Native provides a handy component for displaying a list of data, which is the [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) component. Implement components `RepositoryList` and `RepositoryItem` in the _components_ directory's files _RepositoryList.jsx_ and _RepositoryItem.jsx_. The `RepositoryList` component should render the `FlatList` component and `RepositoryItem` a single item on the list (hint: use the `FlatList` component's [renderItem](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#renderitem) prop). Use this as the basis for the _RepositoryList.jsx_ file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { FlatList, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  separator: {
    height: 10,
  },
});

const repositories = [
  {
    id: 'jaredpalmer.formik',
    fullName: 'jaredpalmer/formik',
    description: 'Build forms in React, without the tears',
    language: 'TypeScript',
    forksCount: 1589,
    stargazersCount: 21553,
    ratingAverage: 88,
    reviewCount: 4,
    ownerAvatarUrl: 'https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4060187?v=4',
  },
  {
    id: 'rails.rails',
    fullName: 'rails/rails',
    description: 'Ruby on Rails',
    language: 'Ruby',
    forksCount: 18349,
    stargazersCount: 45377,
    ratingAverage: 100,
    reviewCount: 2,
    ownerAvatarUrl: 'https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4223?v=4',
  },
  {
    id: 'django.django',
    fullName: 'django/django',
    description: 'The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.',
    language: 'Python',
    forksCount: 21015,
    stargazersCount: 48496,
    ratingAverage: 73,
    reviewCount: 5,
    ownerAvatarUrl: 'https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/27804?v=4',
  },
  {
    id: 'reduxjs.redux',
    fullName: 'reduxjs/redux',
    description: 'Predictable state container for JavaScript apps',
    language: 'TypeScript',
    forksCount: 13902,
    stargazersCount: 52869,
    ratingAverage: 0,
    reviewCount: 0,
    ownerAvatarUrl: 'https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13142323?v=4',
  },
];

const ItemSeparator = () => <View style={styles.separator} />;

const RepositoryList = () => {
  return (
    <FlatList
      data={repositories}
      ItemSeparatorComponent={ItemSeparator}
      // other props
    />
  );
};

export default RepositoryList;
```

_Do not_ alter the contents of the `repositories` variable, it should contain everything you need to complete this exercise. Render the `RepositoryList` component in the `Main` component which we previously added to the _Main.jsx_ file. The reviewed repository list should roughly look something like this:

![Application preview](images/5.jpg)

## Style

Now that we have a basic understanding of how core components work and we can use them to build a simple user interface it is time to add some style. In [part 2](/en/part2/adding_styles_to_react_app) we learned that in the browser environment we can define React component's style properties using CSS. We had an option to either define these styles inline using the `style` prop or in a CSS file with a suitable selector.

There are many similarities in the way style properties are attached to React Native's core components and the way they are attached to DOM elements. In React Native most of the core components accept a prop called `style`. The `style` prop accepts an object with style properties and their values. These style properties are in most cases the same as in CSS, however, property names are in _camelCase_. This means that CSS properties such as `padding-top` and `font-size` are written as `paddingTop` and `fontSize`. Here is a simple example of how to use the `style` prop:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const BigBlueText = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Text style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: 24, fontWeight: '700' }}>
        Big blue text
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

On top of the property names, you might have noticed another difference in the example. In CSS numerical property values commonly have a unit such as _px_, _%_, _em_ or _rem_. In React Native all dimension related property values such as `width`, `height`, `padding`, and `margin` as well as font sizes are _unitless_. These unitless numeric values represent _density-independent pixels_. In case you are wondering what are the available style properties for certain core component, check the [React Native Styling Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/vhpoet/react-native-styling-cheat-sheet).

In general, defining styles directly in the `style` prop is not considered such a great idea, because it makes components bloated and unclear. Instead, we should define styles outside the component's render function using the [StyleSheet.create](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.53/stylesheet#create) method. The `StyleSheet.create` method accepts a single argument which is an object consisting of named style objects and it creates a StyleSheet style reference from the given object. Here is an example of how to refactor the previous example using the `StyleSheet.create` method:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    color: 'blue',
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '700',
  },
});

const BigBlueText = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Big blue text
      <Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

We create two named style objects, `styles.container` and `styles.text`. Inside the component, we can
we can access specific style object the same way we would access any key in a plain object.

In addition to an object, the `style` prop also accepts an array of objects. In the case of an array, the objects are merged from left to right so that latter style properties takes presence. This works recursively, so we can have for example an array containing an array of styles and so forth. If an array contains values that evaluate to false, such as `null` or `undefined`, these values are ignored. This makes it easy to define _conditional styles_ for example, based on the value of a prop. Here is an example of conditional styles:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    color: 'grey',
    fontSize: 14,
  },
  blueText: {
    color: 'blue',
  },
  bigText: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '700',
  },
});

const FancyText = ({ isBlue, isBig, children }) => {
  const textStyles = [
    styles.text,
    isBlue && styles.blueText,
    isBig && styles.bigText,
  ];

  return <Text style={textStyles}>{children}</Text>;
};

const Main = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <FancyText>Simple text</FancyText>
      <FancyText isBlue>Blue text</FancyText>
      <FancyText isBig>Big text</FancyText>
      <FancyText isBig isBlue>
        Big blue text
      </FancyText>
    </>
  );
};
```

In the example we use the `&&` operator with statement `condition && exprIfTrue`. This statement yields `exprIfTrue` if the `condition` evaluates to true, otherwise it will yield `condition`, which in that case is a value that evaluates to false. This is an extremely widely used and handy shorthand. Another option would be to use for example the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator), `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`.

## Consistent user interface with theming

Let's stick with the concept of styling but with a bit wider perspective. Most of us have used a multitude of different applications and might agree that one trait that makes a good user interface is _consistency_. This means that the appearance of user interface components such as their font size, font family and color follow a consistent pattern. To achieve this we have somehow _parametrize_ the values of different style properties. This method is commonly known as _theming_.

Users of popular user interface libraries such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/theming/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) might already be quite familiar with theming. Even though the theming implementations differ the main idea is always to use variables such as `colors.primary` instead of ["magic numbers"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)>) such as `#0366d6` when defining styles. This leads to increased consistency and flexibility.

Let's see how theming could work in practice in our application. We will be using a lot of text with different variations, such as different font sizes and colors. Because React Native does not support global styles we should create our own `Text` component to keep the textual content consistent. Let's get started by adding the following theme configuration object in a _theme.js_ file in the _src_ directory:

```javascript
const theme = {
  colors: {
    textPrimary: '#24292e',
    textSecondary: '#586069',
    primary: '#0366d6',
  },
  fontSizes: {
    body: 14,
    subheading: 16,
  },
  fonts: {
    main: 'System',
  },
  fontWeights: {
    normal: '400',
    bold: '700',
  },
};

export default theme;
```

Next, we should create the actual `Text` component which uses this theme configuration. Create a _Text.jsx_ file in the _components_ directory where we already have our other components. Add the following content to the _Text.jsx_ file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text as NativeText, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

import theme from '../theme';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    color: theme.colors.textPrimary,
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.body,
    fontFamily: theme.fonts.main,
    fontWeight: theme.fontWeights.normal,
  },
  colorTextSecondary: {
    color: theme.colors.textSecondary,
  },
  colorPrimary: {
    color: theme.colors.primary,
  },
  fontSizeSubheading: {
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.subheading,
  },
  fontWeightBold: {
    fontWeight: theme.fontWeights.bold,
  },
});

const Text = ({ color, fontSize, fontWeight, style, ...props }) => {
  const textStyle = [
    styles.text,
    color === 'textSecondary' && styles.colorTextSecondary,
    color === 'primary' && styles.colorPrimary,
    fontSize === 'subheading' && styles.fontSizeSubheading,
    fontWeight === 'bold' && styles.fontWeightBold,
    style,
  ];

  return <NativeText style={textStyle} {...props} />;
};

export default Text;
```

Now we have implemented our own text component with consistent color, font size and font weight variants which we can use anywhere in our application. We can get different text variations using different props like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import Text from './Text';

const Main = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Text>Simple text</Text>
      <Text style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}>Text with custom style</Text>
      <Text fontWeight="bold" fontSize="subheading">
        Bold subheading
      </Text>
      <Text color="textSecondary">Text with secondary color</Text>
    </>
  );
};

export default Main;
```

Feel free to extend or modify this component if you feel like it. It might also be a good idea to create reusable text components such as `Subheading` which use the `Text` component. Also, keep on extending and modifying the theme configuration as your application progresses.

## Using flexbox for layout

The last concept we will cover related to styling is implementing layouts with [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). Those who are more familiar with CSS know that flexbox is not only related to React Native instead it has many use cases in web development as well. In fact, those who know how flexbox works in web development won't probably learn that much from this section. Nevertheless, let's learn or revise the basics of flexbox.

Flexbox is a layout entity consisting of two separate components: a _flex container_ and inside it a set of _flex items_. Flex container has a set of properties that control the flow of its items. To make a component a flex container it must have the style property `display` set as `flex` which is the default value for the `display` property. Here is an example of a flex container:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  flexContainer: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
  },
});

const FlexboxExample = () => {
  return <View style={styles.flexContainer}>{/* ... */}</View>;
};
```

Perhaps the most important properties of a flex container are the following:

- [flexDirection](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-direction/) property controls the direction in which the flex items are laid out within the container. Possible values for this property are `row`, `row-reverse`, `column` (default value) and `column-reverse`. Flex direction `row` will lay out the flex items from left to right, whereas `column` from top to bottom. `*-reverse` directions will just reverse the order of the flex items.
- [justifyContent](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/) property controls the aligment of flex items along the main axis (defined by the `flexDirection` property). Possible values for this property are `flex-start` (default value), `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around` and `space-evenly`.
- [alignItems](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-items/) property does the same as `justifyContent` but for the opposite axis. Possible values for this property are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline` and `stretch` (default value).

Let's move on to flex items. As mentioned, a flex container can contain one or many flex items. Flex items have properties that control how they behave in respect of other flex items in the same flex container. To make a component a flex item all you have to do is to set it as an immediate child of a flex container:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  flexContainer: {
    display: 'flex',
  },
  flexItemA: {
    flexGrow: 0,
    backgrundColor: 'green',
  },
  flexItemB: {
    flexGrow: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  },
});

const FlexboxExample = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.flexContainer}>
      <View style={styles.flexItemA}>
        <Text>Flex item A</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.flexItemB}>
        <Text>Flex item B</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};
```

One of the most commonly used properties of flex item is the [flexGrow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-grow/) property. It accepts a unitless value which defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. If every flex items have a `flexGrow` of `1`, they will share all the available space evenly. If a flex item have a `flexGrow` of `0` it will only use the space its content requires and leave rest of the space for other flex items.

Here is a more interactive and concreate example of how to use flexbox to implement a simple card component with header, body and footer: [Flexbox example](https://snack.expo.io/@kalleilv/3d045d).

<!-- TODO: embedded snack
<div data-snack-id="@kalleilv/flexbox-example" data-snack-platform="web" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="light" style="overflow:hidden;background:#fafafa;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.08);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%"></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.io/embed.js"></script>
-->

Next, read the article [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) which has comprehensive visual examples of flexbox. It is also a good idea to play around with the flexbox properties in the [Flexbox Playground](https://demos.scotch.io/visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-flexbox-playground/demos/) to see how different flexbox properties affect the layout. Remember that in React Native the property names are the same as the ones in CSS except for the _camelCase_ naming. However, the _property values_ such as `flex-start` and `space-between` are exactly the same.

## Exercises 10.4. - 10.5.

### Exercise 10.4.

We will soon need to navigate between different views in our application. That is why need an [app bar](https://material.io/components/app-bars-top/) to display tabs for switching between different views. Create a file _AppBar.jsx_ in the _components_ folder with the following content:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, ScrollView, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
});

const AppBar = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default AppBar;
```

Now that the `AppBar` component will prevent the status bar from overlapping the content, you can remove the `marginTop` style we added for the `Main` component earlier in the _Main.jsx_ file. The `AppBar` component should currently contain a tab with text "Repositories". Make the tab touchable by using the [TouchableWithoutFeedback](https://reactnative.dev/docs/touchablewithoutfeedback) component but you don't have to handle the `onPress` event in any way. Add the `AppBar` component to the `Main` component so that it is the uppermost component in the screen. The `AppBar` component should look something like this:

![Application preview](images/6.jpg)

The background color of the app bar in the image is `#24292e` but you can use any other color as well. It might be a good idea to add the app bar's background color into the theme configuration so that it is easy to change it if needed. Another good idea might be to separate the app bar's tab into its own component such as `AppBarTab` so that it is easy to add new tabs in the future.

### Exercise 10.5.

The current version of the reviewed repositories list looks quite grim. Modify the _RepositoryListItem_ component so that it also displays reporitory author's avatar image. You can implement this by using the [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image) component. Counts, such as number of stars and forks, larger than or equal to 1000 should be displayed in thousands with precision of one decimal and with a "k" suffix. This means that for example fork count of 8439 should be displayed as "8.4k". Also polish the overall look of the component so that the reviewed repositories list looks something like this:

![Application preview](images/7.jpg)

In the image, the `Main` component's background color is set to `#e1e4e8` whereas `RepositoryListItem` component's background color is set to `white`. The language tag's background color is `#0366d6` which is the value of the `colors.primary` variable in the theme configuration. Remember to exploit the `Text` component we implemented earlier. Also when needed, split the `RepositoryListItem` component into smaller components.

## Routing

When we start to expand our application we will need a way to transition between different views such as the repositories view and the sign in view. In [part 7](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/react_router) we got familiar with [React router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/guides/quick-start) library and learned how use it to implement routing in a web application.

Routing in a React Native application is a bit different to routing in a web application. The main difference is that we can't reference pages with URLs which we type in to the browser's address bar and can't navigate back and forth through user's history using the browsers [history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). However, this is just the matter of the router interface we are using.

With React Native we can use the entire React router's core, including the hooks and components. The only difference to the browser environment is that we must replace the _BrowserRouter_ with React Native compatible [NativeRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/api/NativeRouter) provided by the [react-router-native](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/guides/quick-start) library. Let's get started by installing the _react-router-native_ library:

```shell
npm install react-router-native
```

Next, open the _App.js_ file and add the `NativeRouter` component to the `App` component:

<!-- TODO: highlight -->

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { NativeRouter } from 'react-router-native';

import Main from './src/components/Main';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NativeRouter>
      <Main />
    </NativeRouter>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now that the router is in place, let's add our first route to the `Main` componenent in the _Main.jsx_ file:

<!-- TODO: highlight -->

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { Route, Switch, Redirect } from 'react-router-native';

import RepositoryList from './RepositoryList';
import AppBar from './AppBar';
import theme from '../theme';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.mainBackground,
    flexGrow: 1,
    flexShrink: 1,
  },
});

const Main = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <AppBar />
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact>
          <RepositoryList />
        </Route>
        <Redirect to="/" />
      </Switch>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Main;
```

Note that, using the react-router-native library will break Expo's web browser preview. However, other previews will work just like before.

## Exercise 10.6.

Create a file _SignIn.jsx_ in the _components_ directory with the following content:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import Text from './Text';

const SignIn = () => {
  return <Text>The sign in view</Text>;
};

export default SignIn;
```

Set up a route for this `SignIn` component in the `Main` component. Also add a tab with text "Sign in" in to the app bar next to the "Repositories" tab. User should be able to navigate between the two views by pressing the tabs (hint: use the [Link](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/api/Link) component and its [component](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/api/Link/component-func) prop).

As we are adding more tabs to our app bar, it its a good idea to allow horizontal scrolling once the tabs won't fit the screen. The [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview) component is just the right component for the job.

Wrap the tabs in the `AppBar` component's tabs with a `ScrollView` component:

```javascript
const AppBar = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ScrollView horizontal>
        {/* ... */}
      </ScrollView>
    </View>
  );
};
```

Setting the [horizontal](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#horizontal) prop `true` will cause the `ScrollView` component to scroll horizontally once the content won't fit the screen. Note that, you will need to add suitable style properties to the `ScrollView` component so that the tabs will be laid in a _row_ inside the flex container. 

## Form state management

Now that we have a placeholder for the sign in view the next step would be to implement the sign form. Before we get to that let's talk about forms in a more wider perspective.

Implementation of forms relies heavily on the state management. Using the React's `useState` hook for the state management might get the job done for smaller forms. However, it will quickly make the state management quite tedious with more complex forms. Luckily there are many good libraries in the React ecosystem that eases the state management of forms. One of these libraries is [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/).

The main concepts of Formik are the _context_ and a _field_. The Formik's context is provided by the [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik) component that it contains the form's state. The state consists of information of form's fields. This information includes for example the value and validation errors of each field. State's fields can be referenced by their name using the [useField](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/useField) hook or the [Field](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/field) component.

Let's see how this actually works by creating a form for calculating the [body mass index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, TextInput, TouchableWithoutFeedback, View } from 'react-native';
import { Formik, useField } from 'formik';

const initialValues = {
  mass: '',
  height: '',
};

const getBodyMassIndex = (mass, height) => {
  return Math.round(mass / Math.pow(height, 2));
};

const BodyMassIndexForm = ({ onSubmit }) => {
  const [massField, massMeta, massHelpers] = useField('mass');
  const [heightField, heightMeta, heightHelpers] = useField('height');

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Weight (kg)"
        value={massField.value}
        onChangeText={(text) => massHelpers.setValue(text)}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Height (m)"
        value={heightField.value}
        onChangeText={(text) => heightHelpers.setValue(text)}
      />
      <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={onSubmit}>
        <Text>Calculate</Text>
      </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
    </View>
  );
};

const BodyMassIndexCalculator = () => {
  const onSubmit = (values) => {
    const mass = parseFloat(values.mass);
    const height = parseFloat(values.height);

    if (!isNaN(mass) && !isNaN(height) && height !== 0) {
      console.log(`Your body mass index is: ${getBodyMassIndex(mass, height)}`);
    }
  };

  return (
    <Formik initialValues={initialValues} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      {({ handleSubmit }) => <BodyMassIndexForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />}
    </Formik>
  );
};
```

This example is not part of our application, so you don't need to actually add this code to the application. You can however try it out for example in [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/). Expo Snack is an online editor for React Native, similar to [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). It is a useful platform for quickly trying out code. You can share Expo Snacks with others using a link or embedding them as a <i>Snack Player</i> in a web site. You might have bumped into Snack Players for example in this material and React Native documentation.

In the example, we define the `Formik` context in the `BodyMassIndexCalculator` component and provided it with initial values and a submit callback. Initial values are provided through the [initialValues](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#initialvalues-values) prop as an object with field names as keys and the corresponding initial values as values. The submit callback is provided through the [onSubmit](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#onsubmit-values-values-formikbag-formikbag--void--promiseany) prop and it is called when the `handleSubmit` function is called with the condition that there isn't any validation errros. Children of the `Formik` component is a function which is called with [props](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#formik-render-methods-and-props) including state related information and actions such as the `handleSubmit` function.

The `BodyMassIndexForm` component contains the state bindings between the context and text inputs. We use the [useField](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/useField) hook to get the value of a field and to change it. _useField_ hooks has one argument which is the name of the field and it returns an array with three values, `[field, meta, helpers]`. The [field object](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/useField#fieldinputpropsvalue) contains the value of the field, the [meta object](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/useField#fieldmetapropsvalue) contains field meta information such as a posibble error message and the [helpers object](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/useField#fieldhelperprops) contains different actions for changing the state of field such as the `setValue` function. Note that the component that uses the `useField` hook has to be _within the Formik's context_. This means that the component has to be a descendant of the `Formik` component.

Here is an interactive version of our previous example: [Formik example](https://snack.expo.io/@kalleilv/9e9e0d).

<!-- TODO: embedded snack

<div data-snack-id="@kalleilv/formik-example" data-snack-platform="web" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="light" style="overflow:hidden;background:#fafafa;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.08);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%"></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.io/embed.js"></script>
-->

In the previous example using the `useField` hook with the `TextInput` component causes repetitive code. Let's extract this repetitive code into a `FormikTextInput` component and create a custom `TextInput` component to make text inputs a bit more visually pleasing. First, let's install Formik:

```shell
npm install formik
```

Next, create a file _TextInput.jsx_ in the _components_ directory with the following content:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { TextInput as NativeTextInput, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({});

const TextInput = ({ style, error, ...props }) => {
  const textInputStyle = [style];

  return <NativeTextInput style={textInputStyle} {...props} />;
};

export default TextInput;
```

Let's move on to the `FormikTextInput` component that adds the Formik's state bindings to the `TextInput` component. Create a file _FormikTextInput.jsx_ in the _components_ directory with the following content:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useField } from 'formik';

import TextInput from './TextInput';
import Text from './Text';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  errorText: {
    marginTop: 5,
  },
});

const FormikTextInput = ({ name, ...props }) => {
  const [field, meta, helpers] = useField(name);
  const showError = meta.touched && meta.error;

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        onChangeText={(value) => helpers.setValue(value)}
        onBlur={() => helpers.setTouched(true)}
        value={field.value}
        error={showError}
        {...props}
      />
      {showError && <Text style={styles.errorText}>{meta.error}</Text>}
    </>
  );
};

export default FormikTextInput;
```

By using the `FormikTextInput` component we could refactor the `BodyMassIndexForm` component in the previous example like this:

```javascript
const BodyMassIndexForm = ({ onSubmit }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <FormikTextInput name="mass" placeholder="Weight (kg)" />
      <FormikTextInput name="height" placeholder="Height (m)" />
      <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={onSubmit}>
        <Text>Calculate</Text>
      </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Form validation

Formik offers two approaches to the form validation: a validation function or a validation schema. Validation function is a function provided for the `Formik` component as the value of the [validate](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/guides/validation#validate) prop. It receives the from's values as an argument and returns an object containing possible field specific error messages.

The second approach is the validation schema which is provided for the `Formik` component as the value of the [validationSchema](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/guides/validation#validationschema) prop. This validation schema can be created with a validation library called [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup). Let's get started by installing Yup:

```shell
npm install yup
```

Next, as an example, let's create validation schema for the body mass index form we implemented earlier. We wan't to validate that both _mass_ and _height_ fields are present and they are numeric. Also the value of _mass_ should be greater or equal to 1 and the value of _height_ should be greater or equal to 0.5. Here is how we define the schema:

<!-- TODO: highlight  -->

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import * as yup from 'yup';

// ...

const validationSchema = yup.object().shape({
  mass: yup
    .number()
    .min(1, 'Weight must be greater or equal to 1')
    .required('Weight is required'),
  height: yup
    .number()
    .min(0.5, 'Height must be greater or equal to 0.5')
    .required('Height is required'),
});

const BodyMassIndexCalculator = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <Formik
      initialValues={initialValues}
      onSubmit={onSubmit}
      validationSchema={validationSchema}
    >
      {({ handleSubmit }) => <BodyMassIndexForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />}
    </Formik>
  );
};
```

The validation is performed by default every time a field's value changes and when the `handleSubmit` function is called. If the validation fails, the function provided for the `onSubmit` prop of the `Formik` component is not called.

The `FormikTextInput` component we previously implemented displayes field's error message if it is present and the field is "touched", meaning that the field has received and lost focus:

```javascript
const FormikTextInput = ({ name, ...props }) => {
  const [field, meta, helpers] = useField(name);

  // Check if the field is touched and the error message is present
  const showError = meta.touched && meta.error;

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        onChangeText={(value) => helpers.setValue(value)}
        onBlur={() => helpers.setTouched(true)}
        value={field.value}
        error={showError}
        {...props}
      />
      {/* Show the error message if the value of showError variable is true  */}
      {showError && <Text style={styles.errorText}>{meta.error}</Text>}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Exercise 10.7.

Implement a sign in form to the `SignIn` component we added earlier in the _SignIn.jsx_ file. The sign in form should include two text fields, one for the username and one for the password. There should also be a button for submitting the form. Validate the sign in form so that both username and password fields are required. You don't need to implement a `onSubmit` callback function, it is enough that the form values are logged using `console.log` when the form is submitted. You can use this simple function as the `onSubmit` callback function:

```javascript
const onSubmit = (values) => {
  console.log(values);
};
```

Note that the callback _should not be called_ if the form validation fails. The sign in form should look something like this:

![Application preview](images/8.jpg)

Remember to utilize the `FormikTextInput` component we implemented earlier. You will need to add a red border to the `TextInput` component when the `error` prop is `true`. Also use same the red color in the `FormikTextInput` component's error message. The red color used in the image is `#d73a4a`. You can use the [secureTextEntry](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#securetextentry) prop in the `TextInput` component to obscure the password input.

## Platform specific code

A big benefit of React Native is that we don't need to worry about whether the application is run on a Android or iOS device. However, there might be cases where we need to execute _platform specific code_. Such case could be for example using a different implementation of a component on a different platform.

We can access the user's platform through the `Platform.OS` constant:

```javascript
import { React } from 'react';
import { Platform, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    color: Platform.OS === 'android' ? 'green' : 'blue',
  },
});

const WhatIsMyPlatform = () => {
  return <Text style={styles.text}>Your platform is: {Platform.OS}</Text>;
};
```

Possible values for the `Platform.OS` constant are `android` and `ios`. Another useful way to define platform specific code branches is to use the `Platform.select` method. Given an object where keys are one of `ios`, `android`, `native` and `default`, the `Platform.select` method returns the most fitting value for the platform the user is currently running on. We can rewrite the `styles` variable in the previous example using the `Platform.select` method like this:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    color: Platform.select({
      android: 'green',
      ios: 'blue',
      default: 'black',
    }),
  },
});
```

We can even use the `Platform.select` method to require a platform specific component:

```javascript
const MyComponent = Platform.select({
  ios: () => require('./MyIOSComponent'),
  android: () => require('./MyAndroidComponent'),
})();

<MyComponent />;
```

However, a more sophisticated method for implementing and importing platform specific components (or any other piece of code) is to use the _.io.jsx_ and _.android.jsx_ file extensions. Note that the _.jsx_ extension can as well be any extensions recognized by the bundler, such as _.js_. We can for example have files _Button.ios.jsx_ and _Button.android.jsx_ which we can import like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import Button from './Button';

const PlatformSpecificButton = () => {
  return <Button />;
};
```

Now, the Android bundle of the application will have the component defined in the _Button.android.jsx_ whereas the iOS bundle the one defined in the _Button.ios.jsx_ file.

## Exercise 10.8.

Currently the font family of our application is set to _System_ in the theme configuration located in the _theme.js_ file. Instead of the _System_ font, use a platform specific [Sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif) font. In the Android platform use the _Ubuntu_ font and in the iOS platform use the _Arial_ font. The default font can be _System_.
