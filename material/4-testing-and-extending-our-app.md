# Testing and extending our application

Now that we have established a good foundation for our project, it is time to start expanding it. In this section you can put to use all the React Native knowledge you have gained so far. Along with expanding our application we will cover some new areas, such as testing and additional resources.   

## Testing React Native applications

To start testing code of any kind, the first thing we need is a testing framework, which we can use to run a set of test cases and inspect their results. For testing a JavaScript application, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a popular candidate for such testing framework. To use Jest in React Native application, Expo provides a small wrapper library for Jest called [jest-expo](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/jest-expo).
